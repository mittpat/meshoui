# meshoui - Simple Collada parser and viewer

![sample viewer_output](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mittpat/meshoui/vulkan/meshoui/resources/screenshot.png)

Notes
-------

The Collada support is only very very partial. Some Blender files were tested, but other files on the web are known to fail with a blank screen.

This branch targets Vulkan 1.1. Only texture mapping is missing (wip).

Todo
-------
* Texture mapping
* Improve Cameras and Lights
* Nvidia RTX realtime shadows
