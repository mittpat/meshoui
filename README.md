[![sample viewer_output](http://img.youtube.com/vi/u8a1UOh-dHY/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8a1UOh-dHY "Sample video")

Notes
-------

The Collada support is only very very partial. Some Blender files were tested, but other files on the web are known to fail with a blank screen.

This branch targets Vulkan 1.1... its a work in progress. Not currently functional.

Todo
-------
* Get up and running with Vulkan
* Improve Collada file format support
* Improve Cameras and Lights
