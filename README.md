# meshoui - Simple Collada parser and viewer

![sample viewer_output](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mittpat/meshoui/vulkan/meshoui/resources/screenshot.png)

Notes
-------

The Collada support is only very very partial. Some Blender files were tested, but other files on the web are known to fail with a blank screen.

This branch targets Vulkan 1.1... its a work in progress. Not currently functional.

Todo
-------
* Get up and running with Vulkan
* Improve Collada file format support
* Improve Cameras and Lights
