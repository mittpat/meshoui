# meshoui - Simple Collada parser and viewer

[![sample viewer_output](http://img.youtube.com/vi/u8a1UOh-dHY/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8a1UOh-dHY "Sample video")

Notes
-------

The Collada support is only very very partial. Some Blender files were tested, but other files on the web are known to fail with a blank screen.

Currently the target platform is mostly OpenGL ES 2.0 (desktop OpenGL 3.x).
It should run on the software mesa renderer (LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE), Raspberry PI as well as the old Intel GMA900M.

Todo
-------
* Improve Collada file format support
* Improve Cameras and Lights
